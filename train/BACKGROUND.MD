FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel) and DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) are both methods for parallelizing training of models like Transformers across multiple GPUs. 

- FSDP shards the model weights and optimizer states across GPUs, reducing memory usage, which allows training larger models. 
- DDP, on the other hand, replicates the model across GPUs and averages gradients during training, leading to higher memory consumption but simpler synchronization.

FSDP is more suited for very large models, while DDP is often used for standard-sized models where memory isn't a limiting factor. I've also included gradient accumulation in my DDP implementation to effectively manage larger batch sizes and reduce synchronization overhead, which isn't as necessary in FSDP due to its efficient memory usage.
